    <h2>Cricket History</h2>
    <p>
      Cricket, often referred to as "the gentleman's game," has a rich and storied history.
      Originating in the 16th century in England, it has become one of the most popular sports in the world,
      with millions of fans across the globe. The game has evolved over time, from its early days of village cricket
      to the exciting formats we see today, including the fast-paced T20 matches, the 50-over One-Day Internationals (ODIs),
      and the traditional Test matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the greatest moments in sports history have occurred on a cricket field, from iconic players like
      Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, and Sir Donald Bradman to thrilling World Cup finals and record-breaking feats.
